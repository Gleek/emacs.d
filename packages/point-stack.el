;;; Commentary:

;; Provides window-local back and forward stacks for point.
;; Each stack value contains buffer reference, point position,
;; and window scroll position.
;; Both stacks are local to current window, in other words, stacks in
;; different windows are not related.
;;
;; To navigate the stacks, bind back and forward commands to some keys:
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-,") 'point-stack-pop)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-.") 'point-stack-forward-stack-pop)
;;
;; The recommended usage is to save locations automatically on navigation:
;; (point-stack-setup-advices)
;;
;; To push values to stack manually instead, bind the push command:
;; (global-set-key [f5] 'point-stack-push)
;;
;; Based on https://github.com/mattharrison/point-stack
;; which is in turn based on http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/JohnConnors
